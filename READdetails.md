In search of Titanic - Computer Graphics Project

Overview:
The Titanic Submarine Journey is a computer graphics project created as part of the course. It takes you on a journey with a submarine exploring the Titanic wreck. The project starts with the Titanic sinking after hitting an iceberg and continues with the submarine diving deeper into the ocean to discover the remains of the ship.

---------------------------------------------------------

Features:
- Changing Environments: From a cold night with an iceberg to a cloudy noon at a digital village dock and then to the deep ocean.
- Realistic Animations: Watch the Titanic sink, see fish swimming, and sharks circling the wreck.
- Interactive Visuals: Uses 3D graphics techniques to make the scenes look real.

------------------------------------------------------------

Scenes:

1. A Night in the Atlantic
   The Titanic is sailing in the icy ocean at night. It crashes into an iceberg, and the ship starts sinking.

2. Digital Village Submarine at Dock
   The submarine is parked at a dock in a digital village, under a cloudy noon sky. It’s calm and quiet before the submarine starts its journey into the ocean.

3. Into the Depths
   The submarine goes deeper into the ocean. It moves through dark waters, and fish are swimming around.

4. Discovering the Titanic
   At the bottom of the ocean, the submarine finds the sunken Titanic. It’s a dark and spooky scene with sharks swimming around the wreck.
